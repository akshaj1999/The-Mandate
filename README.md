# The-Mandate
This project was especially designed for Manipal Univeristy Jaipur Elections. This is my first project using Node.js and first
time writing code for backend.

# Why we need such a platform?
Currently the procedure of Election is: we have to cast our votes by going to the respective classroom alloted, filling up a 
form and then dropping it into a box.The Process is bit lengthy and requires lot of physical labour and consumes time. 
Hence, this idea came to me to develop a system, which can be easily accessible from anywhere inside and outside the campus 
using a smart-phone or a computer device. This will simplify our life a lot saving our time and our effort.
